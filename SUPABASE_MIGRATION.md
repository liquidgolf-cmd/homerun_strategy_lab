# Migrating from Firestore to Supabase

Supabase uses PostgreSQL, which is a SQL database (unlike Firestore which is NoSQL). This migration requires:

1. Setting up Supabase project
2. Creating database schema (SQL tables)
3. Installing Supabase client library
4. Updating all database operations to use SQL queries
5. Updating backend code

Let me help you set this up!
