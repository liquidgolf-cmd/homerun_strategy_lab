# Fix for 404 Error on localhost:3001

## The Problem

There was an **Express server** running on port 3001 instead of the Vite dev server. This wrong server was:
- Returning 404 errors
- Blocking resources with CSP headers
- Not serving the React app

## The Solution

I've killed the wrong server. Now start the correct servers:

### Step 1: Start Both Servers

From the project root, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- ✅ Backend on http://localhost:3000 (Express API)
- ✅ Frontend on http://localhost:3001 (Vite dev server)

### Step 2: Verify It's Working

1. Wait for both servers to start (you'll see "VITE ready" message)
2. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
3. You should see the Homeruns Strategy Lab landing page

### If Port 3001 Is Still Busy

If you still get errors, kill any remaining processes:

```bash
# Kill anything on port 3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Then start fresh
npm run dev
```

### Verify the Right Server Is Running

When Vite starts correctly, you should see:
```
VITE v5.4.21  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:3001/
```

**NOT** an Express server output.

## What Changed

- Killed the wrong Express server on port 3001
- Your `npm run dev` will now start the correct Vite dev server
