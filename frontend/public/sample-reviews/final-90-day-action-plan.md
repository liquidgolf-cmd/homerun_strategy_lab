# 90-Day Action Plan
## Detailed Execution Guide for Chen Marketing Solutions

**Client**: Sarah Chen, Chen Marketing Solutions  
**Start Date**: January 15, 2024  
**End Date**: April 15, 2024

## 90-Day North Star Outcome

**"In 90 days, it will be a win if I've hired my first employee, delegated 25-30 hours of work per week, and documented my core processes, and this matters to my customer because it enables me to serve more clients effectively while maintaining the quality and responsiveness they value."**

**Why This Matters Now:**
Sarah is at capacity and burning out. She's turning away potential clients and working 60-hour weeks. Without hiring and delegating, she can't grow, and her service quality will decline.

**Why This Matters to Customers:**
- Capacity for more clients without sacrificing quality
- Better service (Sarah focuses on strategy, employee handles routine work)
- Consistency (documented processes ensure consistent quality)
- Growth (Sarah can scale while maintaining personalized service)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Hiring Takes Longer Than Expected

**Mitigation:**
- Start job posting early (Week 4-6), don't wait for perfect process documentation
- Have backup candidates if primary candidate doesn't accept
- Consider contractor/freelancer as interim solution while continuing full hire search

**If Risk Occurs:**
- Extend Project 3 timeline by 2-4 weeks
- Consider interim contractor to maintain momentum
- Adjust Project 4 timeline if needed

### Risk 2: Process Documentation Is Overwhelming

**Mitigation:**
- Start with one process (website launch), complete before moving to next
- Focus on most critical processes first, defer nice-to-have documentation
- Break documentation into smaller milestones (50% complete, 75% complete, 100% complete)

**If Risk Occurs:**
- Reduce scope (document 2 processes instead of 3)
- Extend Project 2 timeline by 2-4 weeks
- Prioritize processes needed for training new hire

### Risk 3: New Hire Doesn't Work Out

**Mitigation:**
- Thorough interview process with multiple candidates
- Trial period (2-4 weeks) before permanent commitment
- Clear expectations and communication from start
- Have backup candidates identified

**If Risk Occurs:**
- End trial period if needed
- Return to hiring process with backup candidates
- Adjust Project 3 timeline accordingly

### Risk 4: Client Work Suffers During Transition

**Mitigation:**
- Plan hiring during slower period (if possible)
- Communicate with clients about changes
- Reduce new client intake during onboarding period if needed
- Set clear boundaries and expectations

**If Risk Occurs:**
- Reduce new client intake temporarily
- Communicate proactively with existing clients
- Adjust Project 3 timeline if needed

### Risk 5: Partnerships Don't Generate Referrals Quickly

**Mitigation:**
- Set realistic expectations (partnerships are long-term)
- Focus on other projects first (lower priority)
- Build relationships gradually, don't rush

**If Risk Occurs:**
- This is lower priority - can extend timeline if other projects take longer
- Focus on building relationships, not immediate referrals
- Reassess in next 90-day cycle
